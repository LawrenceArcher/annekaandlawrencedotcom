            <h3>The story so far</h3>
            <p>Anneka and Lawrence first met on a training ride for a charity cycle from Paris to London. This was a curious meeting as neither were particularly keen on the sport (generally preferring running) but both have a history of signing up for challenges they are woefully unqualified for. </p>
            <p>Despite being a much faster cyclist, Lawrence could be found in close proximity to Anneka across the three day journey from one capital to another, and the easy conversation and laughter provided a welcome distraction from the more difficult parts of the route. Anneka invited Lawrence to her house warming party a week later, and when Lawrence showed up on time and with a fresh haircut, she knew he was interested.</p>
            <p>From that point on quickly they built from friendship into love.</p>
            <p>They've not had the easiest route through, with the first lockdown hitting some nine months later, but thankfully had already established a true partnership to survive it, and were lucky enough to have the endless support of friends and family to pull through what was a pretty big test!</p>
            <p>Fast forward some 2+ years later and Lawrence took Anneka away for a surprise weekend to the New Forest and asked Anneka to marry him in a truly memorable proposal. Anneka had no hesitation in agreeing to spend the rest of their lives together, and they can't wait for you to join them in making it official!</p>

                <h3>The Venue</h3>
                <p>Anneka and Lawrence first met on a training ride for a charity cycle from Paris to London. Neither were actually particularly keen cyclists, generally preferring booze and occasionally the odd run. However they hit it off immediately (or at least so Lawrence believes). Anneka invited Lawrence to her house warming party a week or so later</p>
