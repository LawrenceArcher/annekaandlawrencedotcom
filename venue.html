                <h3>Burley Manor</h3>
                <p>Burley Manor was built in 1852 by Colonel William Clement Drake Esdaile, and is surrounded by rolling countryside and a red deer sanctuary. </p>
                <p>It's also but a minutes' walk from the picture perfect village of Burley with cute cafes and roaming wildlife.</p>
                <p>The New Forest has a lot of meaning for Lawrence & Anneka. It is where they first went away together, with Anneka booking a weekend away there for Lawrence's birthday largely due to the covid restrictions of 2020.</p> 
                <p>Burley Manor itself is where Lawrence proposed to Anneka, in the Shepherd's Hut in the grounds. When relaying the story to Anneka's parents, they also discovered it's where her parents first went away as a couple, so there was no other place for it!</p>
                <hr>
                <p>The wedding venue itself is fully accessible. There are a limited number of accessible bedrooms available, so please let us know if you have any requirements that we are unaware of.</p>
