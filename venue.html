                        <h3>Accomodation</h3>
                        <p>We have booked the whole of Burley Manor for the day and night of the wedding and would love guests to stay with us. We are subsidising all 40 rooms at this 4 star hotel so that the costs to guests are minimised and are offered at the following rates: </p>
                        <p>£120 for shared rooms</p> 
                        <p>£90 for sole occupancy</p> 
                        <p>The individually decorated rooms have their own character and are filled with antique furniture. All come with en-suite, complimentary toiletries from the on site Spa, and a well needed breakfast included the morning after! Please select on your RSVP whether you will be staying with us so that we can allocate rooms accordingly, and indicate whether your party requires an accessible room.</p> 
                        <p>We will subsequently follow up with payment details. Some of the wedding party will be staying at Burley Manor the night previous, and we welcome anyone who would also like to stay the night before to join us for dinner.</p> 
                        <p>If planning to stay the night before the wedding please call the hotel booking line 0800 44 44 41 and use the following code at the time of booking to secure the best rate available and so that we can match your room for the following night: <b>BMW25112022</b>. We encourage you to book these rooms as soon as possible as they are open to the public to book so cannot guarantee availability nearer the wedding date.</p>
                        <p>Staying nearby: If planning on staying external to the hotel we would recommend searching on Airbnb (link) if staying more than one night, or booking.com (nearby properties start at around £109 per night). We would also strongly recommend booking a taxi in advance as there are not many taxi companies in the New Forest, and as we discovered on our September stay, they dial down staff in the "off season". Recommended companies are <a href="http://www.newforest-taxis.co.uk/">New Forest taxis</a>, <a href="https://www.brockenhurst-station-minicabs.com/">Station Taxis Brockenhurst</a>, and <a href="http://www.lyndhurst-taxis.co.uk/">Lyndhurst Taxis</a></p>

                    <h3>The venue</h3>
                    <p>Burley Manor was built in 1852 by Colonel William Clement Drake Esdaile, and is surrounded by rolling
                        countryside and a red deer sanctuary. </p>
                    <p>It's also but a minutes' walk from the picture perfect village of Burley with cute cafes and roaming
                        wildlife.</p>
                    <p>The New Forest has a lot of meaning for Lawrence & Anneka. It is where they first went away together,
                        with Anneka booking a weekend away there for Lawrence's birthday largely due to the covid restrictions
                        of 2020.</p>
                    <p>Burley Manor itself is where Lawrence proposed to Anneka, in the Shepherd's Hut in the grounds. When
                        relaying the story to Anneka's parents, they also discovered it's where her parents first went away as a
                        couple, so there was no other place for it!</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>The wedding venue itself is fully accessible. There are a limited number of accessible bedrooms
                        available, so please let us know if you have any requirements that we are unaware of.</p>
