    <div class="content-section" id="walk">
        <p>The thing we love to do the most in the New Forest is walk! Here are some of our favourite places to go:</p>
        <div class="thing-card">
            <h3>Brockenhurst</h3>
            <p>Brockenhurst is a great place to set out for a longer circular walk that will take you through forests,
                streams, and lots of wild ponies. We recommend downloading the All Trails app and looking at their
                different length walks setting out from this village. There are plenty of places for parking as well as
                some nice cafes for refreshment!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="thing-card">
            <h3>Rhinefield Ornamental Drive</h3>
            <p>Even if you don't fancy a walk, take a drive down this stunning drive with trees taller than Big Ben!
                There is a lovely, short circular route that is easy under foot and takes in the best of the impressive
                trees.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="thing-card">
            <h3>Lymington Nature Reserve</h3>
            <p>If, like Anneka, you're a bird lover, you won't want to miss the Lymington Nature Reserve, a flat easy
                walk with beautiful coastal views. Don't forget your binoculars!</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="content-section" id="eat">
        <div class="thing-card">
            <h3>The Elderflower</h3>
            <p>This restaurant is where Anneka & Lawrence ate before he proposed. It is absolutely delicious and offers
                a variety of tasting menus with the option of wine pairings. Be warned, they are very generous wine
                pairings!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="thing-card">
            <h3>Verveine</h3>
            <p>A fish only restaurant that has no menu! Inform the restaurant pre-booking if you have any allergies or
                dislikes and be prepared to be wowed by the dishes.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="thing-card">
            <h3>Noohn</h3>
            <p>Probably the best coffee in the New Forest! We love this little cafe in Burley. The staff are super
                friendly and their sandwiches and cakes are exceptional.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="content-section" id="relax">
        <p>If you are staying with us the day before or after, there is a spa on site at Burley Manor offering a range
            of treatments from facials to massages. Please visit the site for more details - <a
