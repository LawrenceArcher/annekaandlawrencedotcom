    <h3>The story so far</h3>
    <p>Anneka and Lawrence first met on a training ride for a charity cycle from Paris to London. This was a curious
        meeting as neither were particularly keen on the sport (generally preferring running) but both have a history of
        signing up for challenges they are woefully unqualified for. </p>
    <p>Despite being a much faster cyclist, Lawrence could be found in close proximity to Anneka across the three day
        journey from one capital to another, and the easy conversation and laughter provided a welcome distraction from
        the more difficult parts of the route. Anneka invited Lawrence to her house warming party a week later, and when
        Lawrence showed up on time and with a fresh haircut, she knew he was interested.</p>
    <p>From that point on quickly they built from friendship into love.</p>
    <p>Fast forward some 2+ years later and Lawrence took Anneka away for a surprise weekend to the New Forest and asked
        Anneka to marry him in a truly memorable proposal. Anneka had no hesitation in agreeing to spend the rest of
        their lives together, and they can't wait for you to join them in making it official!</p>
