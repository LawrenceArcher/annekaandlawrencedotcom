                <h3>The story so far</h3>
                <p>Anneka and Lawrence first met on a training ride for a charity cycle from Paris to London. Neither were actually particularly keen cyclists, generally preferring booze and occasionally the odd run. However they hit it off immediately (or at least so Lawrence believes). Anneka invited Lawrence to her house warming party a week or so later</p>
