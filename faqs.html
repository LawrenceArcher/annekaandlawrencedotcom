                <h3>Are children allowed?</h3>
                <p>This is a child-free wedding, and an adult only hotel, but of course we welcome babes in arms. We would ask
                    those bringing babies to please be mindful of noise during the ceremony itself. Please notify us if you are
                    staying at the hotel with a baby so we can identify the most suitable room.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq">
                <h3>Can I bring a plus one?</h3>
                <p>This is a smaller wedding and therefore unfortunately there are no plus ones available.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq">
                <h3>Is there parking at the venue?</h3>
                <p>Yes there is plenty of parking available at the venue.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq">
                <h3>Will any parts of the wedding be outdoors?</h3>
                <p>Unless we experience unseasonably warm weather in November, all parts of the wedding will be indoors, except
                    for the obligatory confetti moment.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq">
                <h3>Can I bring confetti?</h3>
                <p>You can absolutely bring confetti as long as it's biodegradable! We will also be bringing dried rose
                    petals.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq">
                <h3>Can I take photos?</h3>
                <p>We will have a professional photographer on the day, but you are more than welcome to take as many photos as
                    you like, except during the ceremony for which we would love you to be as in the moment as us!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq">
                <h3>What should I wear?</h3>
                <p>We want everyone to wear whatever makes them feel amazing! The dress code is smart, so a suit and tie for
                    gentlemen (and any ladies who rock a suit). Hats can be worn if you would like but are not essential. No
                    trainers.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq">
                <h3>Is there a Gift List?</h3>
                <p>Your presence on the day is present enough! But if you would like to get us something we will be putting a
                    gift list on the website nearer the time, or accepting any money to go towards our honeymoon.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq">
                <h3>When should I arrive?</h3>
                <p>Please arrive no later than 12:30pm for a 1pm ceremony. The bride does not intend on being late!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq">
                <h3>What can I expect throughout the day?</h3>
                <p>Hopefully a lot of fun! But on a practical level, after the ceremony there will be drinks and canapes pre-wedding breakfast around 3:30pm. Evening guests will arrive at 7pm in time for dancing, cake-cutting, and more food (buffet style) served from 8:30pm!</p>
